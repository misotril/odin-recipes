    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Fried chicken is a popular dish made by coating chicken pieces in a seasoned batter 
        or breading and deep-frying them until golden and crispy. The exterior is crunchy, 
        while the inside remains juicy and tender. It's often seasoned with a variety of spices, 
        and can be served with sides like mashed potatoes, coleslaw, or biscuits. 
        Fried chicken is beloved for its savory flavor and satisfying texture, 
        making it a classic comfort food in many cultures.
