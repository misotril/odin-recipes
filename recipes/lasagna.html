    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Lasagna is a classic Italian dish known for its rich, comforting layers of flavor. 
        It typically consists of wide, flat pasta sheets stacked with a variety of fillings, 
        all baked together into a hearty casserole. 
        The most common version includes a meaty tomato sauce 
        (often made with ground beef, pork, or a combination), 
        a creamy ricotta cheese mixture (sometimes blended with spinach or other herbs), and a generous layer of mozzarella cheese. 
        The dish is then topped with more cheese, often Parmesan, before being baked until bubbly and golden
        A timeless comfort food, lasagna is often made for family gatherings, holidays, or special occasions.
